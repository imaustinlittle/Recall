# Recall

Self-hosted meeting transcription platform. Record live audio or upload existing files and get an editable, searchable transcript with speaker labels, AI summaries, and timestamped notes — all running locally with no cloud dependencies.

---

## Features

- **Transcription** — local Whisper model (tiny → large-v3), no cloud API
- **Speaker diarization** — optional pyannote.audio labels each speaker
- **Transcript editor** — inline editing, split/merge segments, speaker renaming
- **AI summary** — auto-generated via local Ollama LLM after transcription; re-runnable after renaming speakers
- **Summary → Notes** — one-click import of action items and decisions from the summary into structured notes
- **Timestamped notes** — general, action item, decision, and question note types linked to audio timestamps; keyboard shortcut (D) while listening
- **Export** — TXT, Markdown, SRT, VTT, PDF
- **Full-text search** — search across meeting titles, transcripts, and notes
- **Speaker profiles** — see all unique speaker names across meetings and which recordings they appear in
- **Calendar sidebar** — browse meetings by date; dot indicators on days with recordings
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — A (back 10s), S (play/pause), D (add note), F (forward 10s), Q (rename speaker)

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript |
| Backend | Python FastAPI |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Queue | Redis + Celery |
| Transcription | faster-whisper (local) |
| Diarization | pyannote.audio 3 (optional) |
| Summarization | Ollama (local LLM, default: llama3.1:8b) |
| Storage | Local filesystem / MinIO (S3-compatible) |
| Proxy | Traefik (production) |

## Quick start

### Option A — Pull from GitHub Container Registry (recommended)

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imaustinlittle/recall/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imaustinlittle/recall/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set at minimum:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pick_a_strong_password
SECRET_KEY=pick_a_long_random_string
```

Then pull and start:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Option B — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imaustinlittle/recall.git
cd recall
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env as above
docker compose up --build
```

First run bakes the Whisper model into the image — takes 2–5 minutes.

### Open the app

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Recall | http://localhost:3000 |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/api/docs |
| Flower (Celery monitor) | http://localhost:5555 (run with `--profile dev`) |

Register an account at http://localhost:3000/login, create a meeting, and either record directly in the browser or upload an existing audio/video file.

## Whisper model sizes

Set `WHISPER_MODEL` in `.env`:

| Model | VRAM | Speed | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tiny` | ~1 GB | Very fast | Low |
| `base` | ~1 GB | Fast | OK |
| `small` | ~2 GB | Medium | Good |
| `medium` | ~5 GB | Slow | Great |
| `large-v3` | ~10 GB | Very slow | Best |

Start with `base` and upgrade once you're happy with the setup. Model can also be changed at runtime via **Settings** in the UI without rebuilding.

---

## Speaker diarization (optional)

Diarization identifies who spoke when. **Disabled by default** — requires extra setup.

1. Accept the model license at https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
2. Create a HuggingFace access token at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```bash
   USE_DIARIZATION=true
   HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here
   ```
4. Rebuild: `docker compose up --build`

Or enable it from the **Settings** page in the UI without rebuilding.

---

## AI summarization (Ollama)

Summaries run locally via Ollama. On first deploy, pull the model:

```bash
docker exec recall_ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

This is a one-time ~5 GB download. Summaries generate automatically after transcription completes, or can be triggered manually from the meeting page. The model can be changed from the **Settings** page.

---

## Useful commands

```bash
# View live logs
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f worker

# Run migrations after model changes
docker compose exec api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe_change"
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head

# Open a database shell
docker compose exec postgres psql -U recall -d recall

# Start Celery monitor (Flower)
docker compose --profile dev up flower
# → http://localhost:5555

# Restart just the worker (after config changes)
docker compose restart worker

# Tear everything down (keeps volumes)
docker compose down

# Tear down and delete all data
docker compose down -v
```
